# Identifying Market Regimes using Hidden Markov Models

Presentation given on 06 March, 2023. 

Abstract: In this talk we introduce the idea of a (hidden) Markov Chain. We will then explore using this idea to model market regimes based on the daily returns of the S&P 500 index. We will outline the general structure of Hidden Markov Models, optimization methods to fit our model to a given time series, and then we will use the hmmr package in R to fit our desired model to the daily returns time series. We will then be able to use this model to gain insight into our expectation for returns for the subsequent day.
