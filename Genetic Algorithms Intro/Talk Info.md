# A Sampling of Gradient Free Optimization Techniques

Presentation given on 06 November, 2023. 

Abstract: Continuing our discussion on gradient-free optimization methods, we will explore various concepts in Genetic Algorithms applied to the traveling salesman problem (TSP). We will start with a naive introduction to the concept, and build our way to a more complicated algorithm using evolution inspired concepts including elitism, sexual and asexual reproduction, (natural) selection methods, mutations, and population islands and migrations between them. We will conclude by comparing our final algorithm to simulated annealing (a general gradient-free optimization algorithm) and the 2-opt algorithm (designed specifically to solve to TSP).
