# A Brief Introduction to Neural Networks and Back Propogation

Whiteboard talk given on 07 November, 2022. Notes are in PDF form in this folder. 

Abstract: This talk will cover a brief overview of gradient descent, neural networks, and the back propagation method of computing a gradient for a given neural network. We will not go into detail on the general capabilities or limitations of neural networks, but we will outline the structure of such models and their inspiration.
