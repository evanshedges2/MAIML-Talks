# A Sampling of Gradient Free Optimization Techniques

Presentation given on 16 Oct, 2023. 

Abstract: In this talk I will introduce a few approaches to solve an optimization problem when you do not have access to a derivative. These kinds of problems arise frequently in the real world (hyper parameter tuning, chemical process optimization, etc.) and require a different approach than the typical optimization methods we first learn (e.g. gradient descent or finding an analytic solution). We will discuss random search (and variations), coordinate descent, and particle swarm optimization with an eye towards a future talk on genetic algorithms.
