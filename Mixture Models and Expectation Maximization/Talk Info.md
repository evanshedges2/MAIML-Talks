# Mixture Models and Expectation Maximization

Presentation given on 13 February, 2023. 

Abstract: In this talk we will discuss mixture models and the Expectation Maximization algorithm for identifying maximally likely model parameters. In general, a mixture model is appropriate when data to be modeled comes from multiple sub-populations that have their own distinct distribution functions. An example of this is financial returns, which behave differently in normal times and times of crisis. Mixture models may be applied in this situation to discover the underlying distributions of these two distinct sub-populations of return profiles, even if we do not know which dayâ€™s return comes from which sub-population. Using R, we will also discuss implementation of the Expectation Maximization algorithm as it pertains to mixture models.
